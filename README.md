As part of our automata project, we undertook the task of defining the language specifications, including variables, identifiers, data types, loops, keywords, and conditional statements, each accompanied by their respective regular expressions, derivations, and parse trees, laying the foundation for our implementation. Subsequently, we proceeded to apply the Context-Free Grammar (CFG) concept, utilizing the power of the C++ programming language, to effectively incorporate CFGs into the implementation of loops and variables, further enhancing the functionality and versatility of our project.
